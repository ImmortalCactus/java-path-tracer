# Java Path Tracer
## Introduction
This is a Java implementation of a simple path tracer. This is mainly for me practicing Java OOP. The idea and code structure is mostly from the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) series. This is a WIP.
## Features
- Spheres
- Meshes from .obj files
- Configurable camera
- Materials
    - Lambertian
    - Metallic
    - Dielectric
- Multithreading
- Spatial octree for faster ray intersection
## Roadmap
- Lights
- Textures
- Rigid Transform
